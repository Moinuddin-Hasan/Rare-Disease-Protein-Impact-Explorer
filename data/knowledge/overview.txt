Rare-Disease Structural Anomaly Detector — Knowledge Base

This app visualizes protein structural risk signals from AlphaMissense and AlphaFold.

Key concepts:
- Anomaly Score: AlphaMissense pathogenicity score per variant (0 to 1). Higher implies higher predicted risk.
- Instability Plot (2D): per-residue average anomaly score along the sequence.
- Model Confidence (pLDDT): per-residue confidence from AlphaFold PDB B-factors (0 to 100).
- Hotspots: clusters of high-risk residues that are close in 3D space (DBSCAN on C-alpha coordinates).

How to interpret:
- Tall peaks in the Instability Plot show residues with high predicted impact.
- pLDDT indicates confidence; low pLDDT regions are less reliable structurally.
- Hotspots indicate spatial grouping of risky residues, not just sequence proximity.

Limitations:
- These are research predictions, not clinical diagnostics.
- Visual overlays may be used to emphasize regions of interest.
